                    by simply creating a profile with media content posted as

                <p>Creators can gain independence through a decentralised digital currency system that is
        dependent on growing and engaging with the community and also their star power. They own
        10-15% of the total value of the tokens minted.</p>

                    content, private communities, direct access to celebrity, early- access to tickets and more as well as the ability to trade with other communities in order to gain access to more creator content with early token buyers being the biggest winners as the value of the token increases with more buyers. </p>

                    We would get them on our

                    create a fan driven digital economy where their 
                    digital content can be traded as NFTs and their 
                    most loyal fans can have the monetary value of

Our goal is to bring mass adoption to the cryptocurrency space by dumbing it down. How far down? So down that even a celebrity can explain it in simple words to their followers and have them download an app, buy into the social currency of their favourite person and watch their
                investment as is with other crypto currency project.</span><br /><br />

We are gamefying digital currency, bringing in popular faces instead of hard to understand projects to make it the norm and inadvertently being the "gateway drug" for a lot of people to finally give this space a real look. </span>

                    <span class="text">There would be new markets and advertisers with little to offer would not find home there. Like Kanye said,</span> <br /> <br />

                    <span class="text">Currency is digital, it has been that way for a while now, but this time there would be no dead presidents on the money, there would people like you on the money, and you would own it because it would make the most sense in the world.</span>
